# Code Refactor Starter Code

## HTML Changes and CSS Styling

For the starter code given, I fixed the issues with the semantic HTML elements to the header to link properly when used to navigate the webpage.  I also, incorporated redundant elements in the CSS to reduce lines of code and to create a more seamless styling.  Alt tags were placed on the images as requested.  A title was added to the page as well.
